4. `cd your-app-name`
5. `npm install`
6. **Make a subreddit**: Make a private subreddit on Reddit.com. This will be where you do your own development. Go to Reddit.com, scroll the left side bar down to communities, and click "Create a community."
7. **Update the name in package.json**: Find the `dev:devvit` command and replace `YOUR_SUBREDDIT_NAME` with the subreddit name you just created.
8. **Update yaml file**: In `devvit.yaml` replace `YOUR_APP_NAME` with the name of your app. This will be shown to users that play your app.
9. **Upload**: Run `npm run deploy` and go through the prompts
10. **Playtest**: Run `npm run dev` to playtest your application in production by going to your subreddit. Create a post using the subreddit menu action called "Word Guesser: New Post".

## Commands

- `npm run dev`: Starts a development server where you can develop your application live on Reddit.
- `npm run deploy`: Uploads a new version of your app
- `npm run check`: Type checks, lints, and prettifies your app

## Cursor Integration

This template comes with a pre-configured cursor environment. To get started, [download cursor](https://www.cursor.com/downloads) and enable the `devvit-mcp` when prompted.
