description: Use when writing Devvit apps
globs: src/devvit/**/*
alwaysApply: false

Important rules
- Never write React or reference react, only write valid Devvit
- Never use web or node APIs. This app is ran in a controlled sandbox
- Never suggest using dependencies from NPM since they will likely not work
- Before making code changes, call devvit_search and follow the documentation precisely
